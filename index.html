        <p>Born as the Boy Who Lived, he survived Lord Voldemort's deadly curse as an infant, earning him a reputation as a symbol of hope in the wizarding world. 
            Raised by his neglectful relatives, the Dursleys, Harry discovers his true identity as a wizard upon receiving his acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br> 
            With unruly black hair, round glasses, and a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, Harry's appearance is instantly recognizable. Throughout his journey, Harry exhibits remarkable bravery, unwavering loyalty to his friends, and an innate sense of justice. 
            As he matures, he faces numerous challenges, honing his magical skills, and eventually standing up against the dark forces threatening the wizarding world, cementing his place as a true hero.</p>
